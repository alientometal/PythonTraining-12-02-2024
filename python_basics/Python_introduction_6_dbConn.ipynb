    "SQLite is a popular, lightweight, open-source, and self-contained relational database management system. It is a file-based database, meaning that the entire database is stored in a single file on disk, making it easy to move or share the database without any server or network infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQLite supports most of the standard SQL syntax for creating, querying, and modifying relational databases, including data definition language (DDL) statements such as `CREATE TABLE` and `ALTER TABLE`, data manipulation language (DML) statements such as `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`, and data control language (DCL) statements such as `GRANT` and `REVOKE`.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQLite is widely used in embedded systems, mobile applications, and small-scale web applications, as it provides a fast, efficient, and reliable way to store and retrieve data. It is also popular among developers who want to prototype or test applications quickly and easily without needing to set up a more complex database system.\n",
