    "So far, we know how to define variables, so we can create slightly more advanced code blocks. The first thing we want to do is create a new variable called `under_age` and we will need to define it using a contitional statement. To do this, it will be useful to remember the comparison operators (`<, >, <=, >=, ==, !=`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is as follows, if the person is a minor, the value of this variable will be ``True`` and will be ``False`` in the other case.\n",
